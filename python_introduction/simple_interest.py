# Define the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount (initial investment)
rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
time = 3  # Time the money is invested for in years

# Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
